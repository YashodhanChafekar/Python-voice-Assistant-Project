# Python-voice-Assistant-Project
This project works on Raspberry Pi host. It uses speech recognition and python text to speech converter at its core.
Welcome Everyone. This is my Raspberry Pi Voice assistant project. 
This code in main.py file is all you need and other are files that are not essential dependancies which you can change according to your needs. 
While using this project you will need to install all packages specified in main.py file with import statements.
This Voice assistant is loaded with features. 
Due to Great Compatibility I have used google components everywhere in app.
This project also has GUI created with Tkinter. It is very minimal app with few buttons. 
Name of my virtual assistant is Thea inspired form character in movie Eternals played by Anjelina Joulie.
GUI Window.

As this project was done on Raspberry Pi, the development on windows and then switching to raspberry pi os was full of changes. 
This code I applied here is from windows machine. 
The main difference is you don't get to use sweet assistant voices from windows to linux as it is.
Following are the features Thea has or can have with simple additions.
Note Making, Text to pdf conversion, checking calender, checking emails, search locations, cricket score, internet speed, open youtube, newsfeed,
open website, and many more.
